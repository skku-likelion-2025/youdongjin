        <span id='first' class="js">JavaScript</span>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core <span>technology</span> of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for webpage behavior.
        Web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine that executes the client code. These <span>engines</span> are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
